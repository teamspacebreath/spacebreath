        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          At <strong>SpaceBreath</strong>, we believe that breathing is more than just a biological
          function—it’s a gateway to inner peace, clarity, and transformation. Our mission is to
          guide you through the powerful practice of breathwork, helping you discover the profound
          connection between breath and well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our carefully crafted guided breathwork sessions, we create a safe space for you
          to explore mindfulness, reduce stress, and unlock your inner potential. Whether you’re new
          to breathwork or looking to deepen your practice, our sessions are designed to meet you
          where you are on your journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join our community and experience the transformative power of conscious breathing. Every
          breath is an opportunity to reconnect with yourself and find peace in the present moment.
